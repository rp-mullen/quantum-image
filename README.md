## Description:
2D Image data is cast as as a wavefunction and evolves under the action of its own self-influencing gravitational potential. Half-steps in xy-space occur between full shifts in k-space in order to propagate the wavefunction through one full time step. Transformations between the spatial and momentum bases are facillitated by an FFT/iFFT of the wave function data.
