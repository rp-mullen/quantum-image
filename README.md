## Description:
Image data is cast as an NxN numpy array and evolved as a wavefunction in a system where the image itself serves as its own gravitational Poisson potential. Half-steps in xy-space occur between full shifts in k-space. Transformations between the two are facillitated by an FFT of the wave function data.
